# WCFBankServiceCloud

This project was done as part of my software engineering degree.
The project was to create a service-oriented architecture of a bank system. 
This part of the system is the service available as a web service, and is hosted on Microsoft azure.
It communicates with a web application made with Angular.js, a mobile application made in Android studio and a console application made with C# in Visual Studio.
The service receives REST-requests from the different applications and returns JSON data. 
The web service is created with C# in Visual Studio.

This project is no longer active!
